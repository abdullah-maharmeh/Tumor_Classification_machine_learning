# Tumor_Classification_machine_learning
In this project, we have data representing breast ultrasound images among women between 25 and 75 years old. We need to use machine learning and image processing techniques to classify the image tumor and the type of tumor.

## Note about this repo:- 
* We also created an API for this model based on the Flask framework, you can check app.py to check the code.
* You can find image processing techniques that we also try in the notebook "image pipeline " (we don't use this pipeline in modeling)
